# Basic information about me 
My name is Kristina Golden, and I am a student in the MS Statistics program at NCSU.

I currently work as an AP Statistics/NC Math 4 teacher at a high school in Eastern North Carolina. I hold many additional roles at the school I work at:

1. I am the BT coordinator. This means I run the mentor program for teachers with less than 3 years of experience.
2. To help my collegues pursue their National Board Certification, I facilitate professional development.
3. I am an active member of my school's Strategic Planning Meeting.
4. I am the advisor of two clubs.  
    +National Honor Society  
    +Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society

In addtion to teaching, I am also a wife, and a mother to a 6 year girl and a 3 year old boy.

Needless to say I live a very busy life.

# Summer Internship  
I am very glad to be taking this class this summer. This summer, I am working as a statistical intern for the US Navy. There is an expectation that I can use R on the basic level. I have used R for several classes, but I have never learned how to code intuitively. I know this class is going to help me be succesfful during my internship. 

The internship I am working this summer has real potential to become a new career for me. I will be working with logisticians to analyze data gathered on the brand new H-53K King Stallions.
