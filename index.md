In addtion to teaching, I am also a wife to my husband Stephen, and a mother to a 6 year girl and a 3 year old boy.

Needless to say I live a very busy life.

# Summer Internship  
I am very glad to be taking this class this summer. This summer, I am working as a statistical intern for the US Navy. There is an expectation that I can use R on the basic level. I have used R for several classes, but I have never learned how to code intuitively. I know this class is going to help me be succesfful during my internship. 

The internship I am working this summer has real potential to become a new career for me. I will be working with logisticians to analyze data gathered on the brand new H-53K King Stallions.
