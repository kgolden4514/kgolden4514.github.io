## What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

My current thoughts in terms of using R for data science is that I have really enjoyed learning more about this topic. At times data science can be complicated, but Ihave learned so much. I do see myself continuing to use R going forward. Within the next year or two, my summer internship will likely turn into a career change for me. It will be expected that I perform data science tasks. 

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I have learned how to code in a more intuitive way. I will not have to code purely on guess and check basis like I was before this course. I also had no idea what machine learning was before this course. I am now interested in becoming someone that is very knowledgeable in the field. I will be reading machine learning books.

## what areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?

In the short term, I will be using what I learned to teach AP statistics. I am currently working on having R installed on all of my students' laptops. They will begin learning to code! I am very excited about this new feature of my class. In ths long term, I will be using this knowledge to do machine learning and data science for the US Navy. I will be doing this as part of a data analytics team made up of engineers and data scientists. The plane I will be focused on is the H-53 helicopter.
