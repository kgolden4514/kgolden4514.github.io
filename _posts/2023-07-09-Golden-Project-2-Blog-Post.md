## Project 2 Blog Post

Once you’ve completed the project each of you should write a brief blog
post outlining your project and two links to the
username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself (the username may
correspond to your partner). You should then also reflect on the process
you went through. Discuss the following:

## What would you do differently?

I tend to have major confusion with github. I can never get my .md files
to include graphs. I have trouble getting the github pages to deploy. I
do the coding for every homework/project without major issue, and then I
spend hours trying to get it to show up on github. I feel like it
shouldn’t be that difficult, and that I am doing something majorly
wrong. I have tried looking up my issues online, and I have not found
very convincing answers as of now. So what would I do differently? Try
to get my github pages to work much, much earlier. We did end up figuring it out in the end though. 

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was honestly github pages. I did not have
problem with collaboration through github, I only have a problem with
github pages. I also thought the amount of time the random forest takes
to run makes things difficult. It makes troubleshooting any problems
difficult. The most difficult part appeared to be the automation. 
Thankfully, my partner worked very hard to figure that part out.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

I have definitely gotten better at using R. Doing things like selecting
certain columns in a dataframe and troubleshooting warning/error
messages used to be really difficult for me. Now I can do it without
major issue. This class has also made me better at my internship as a data analayst for the CH-53K helicopter
I am also working on getting R and RStudio downloaded on my AP Statistics
students' laptops. I would love to introduce them to coding early. I feel 
like now that I have gotten better at it, I can teach the basics to them.
Not to be redundant, but another major takeaway is the need
to understand how to make github pages.
